# flexIS
FlexIS is an information system that has been proposed to record and manage employee requests for flexible work within an organization. Employees will write in to their supervisors, who will review the requests and decide on whether to allow it. If the requests are approved, the employees will have to submit their daily schedule so that the supervisors will know where they are and what they will be working on. In this way, the productivity of the employees can be tracked so that the organization can determine if the flexible working arrangements have been a success.
